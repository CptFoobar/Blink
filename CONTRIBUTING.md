## Contributing

This the Blink v1 branch. There's a lot to be done in this project, a rough
draft for the v1 targets can be found in the README of the v1 branch. Feel free
to suggest more (open a ticket). Implementing new features would be awesome.

### Settings things up

#### Mozilla Firefox

For contributing to Blink, you'll need the following:

* [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [jpm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jpm)
* [Firefox SDK Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials#getting-started)

Now grab the source and check if everything works:

```bash
cd /path/to/source/
jpm run
```

If a new Firefox window pops up, and the new tab is replaced by the Blink tab, you're good to go :+1:

#### Google Chrome

Beginning port to Google Chrome. v1.0.0 for Google Chrome will be exact replica of v1.0.2 Firefox.

Pull requests welcome. Please base bug-fixes on the develop branch. To contribute towards the development of v1, competing the TODOs and fixing the FIXMEs will be highly appreciated :smile:. Implementing new features would be awesome.
