## Contributing

There's a lot to be done in this project, a rough draft for the v1 targets an be
 found in the README of the v1 branch. Feel free to suggest more (open a ticket).

#### Settings things up

For contributing to Blink, you'll need the following:

* [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [jpm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jpm)


Now grab the source and check if everything works:

```bash
cd /path/to/source/
jpm run
```

If a new Firefox window pops up, and the new tab is replaced by the Blink tab, you're good to go :+1:

Pull requests welcome. Please base bug-fixes on the develop branch. To contribute towards the development of v1, competing the TODOs and fixing the FIXMEs will be highly appreciated :smile:
